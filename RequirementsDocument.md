# Requirements Document  
**Project:** Chrome Profile Cleanup Automation  
**Date:** June 12, 2025

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a script or application that automates the cleanup of browsing data (cache, cookies, history, etc.) for all Google Chrome profiles on a user’s computer. This tool will help users reduce disk usage, improve browser performance, and protect privacy by removing unnecessary or sensitive data across all profiles without manual intervention.

---

## 2. Scope

- The tool will identify all Chrome profile folders within the Chrome User Data directory.
- It will analyze and, upon explicit user command, delete or clear specific types of browsing data (e.g., cache, cookies, history, downloads) in each profile.
- The tool will support Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.
- The tool will provide options for users to select which data types to clean.
- The tool will ensure Chrome is not running before performing cleanup to prevent data corruption.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Profile Detection (Required)
- Automatically locate the Chrome User Data directory based on the operating system.
- Detect all existing profile folders (e.g., `Default`, `Profile 1`, `Profile 2`, etc.).

### 3.2 Default Behavior: Dry Run and Reporting

By default, the application will:

- **Scan all Chrome profiles** within the User Data directory on the user’s system.
- **Analyze each profile** to identify the types and amounts of data (e.g., cache, cookies, history, downloads, autofill, site settings, saved passwords) that can be cleaned.
- **Generate and display a detailed report** for the user, listing:
  - Each profile found
  - The specific data types that would be cleaned per profile
  - The estimated amount of disk space that would be freed by cleaning each profile and in total
- **Take no destructive action** (no data is erased or changed) unless the user explicitly provides a command-line flag or setting (e.g., `--clean` or `--execute`) to confirm the cleanup operation.

This dry run/reporting mode ensures users can review exactly what the tool will do and how much space will be saved before any changes are made, minimizing the risk of accidental data loss and increasing transparency.

**Optional Feature:**  
- Allow users to export the report to a file (e.g., TXT, CSV, or HTML) for record-keeping or further review.

### 3.3 Optional Profile Cleanup Functionalities

The following features are **optional** and can be included based on project scope and user needs:

| Feature                                      | Description                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Type Selection**                       | Allow users to choose which types of data to clean for each profile (cache, cookies, history, downloads, autofill, site settings, saved passwords—with explicit warning). |
| **Selective or Bulk Cleanup**                 | Enable cleaning of all profiles at once (bulk) or selected individual profiles.                             |
| **Safety Checks**                            | Detect if Chrome is running and prompt user to close it before cleanup; offer option to back up profile data before cleaning. |
| **User Confirmation**                        | Display a summary of selected actions and request user confirmation before proceeding with cleanup.         |
| **Execution of Cleanup**                     | Delete or securely erase selected data types from each targeted profile directory; ensure system/special profiles are excluded. |
| **Logging and Reporting**                    | Log all actions taken (profiles cleaned, data types deleted, errors/skipped actions) and provide a summary report post-cleanup. |
| **Custom Scheduling**                        | Allow users to schedule regular automatic cleanups (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).                          |
| **Cross-Platform Support**                   | Ensure all functionalities work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.                                               |
| **Extensibility**                            | Design tool to allow for future addition of new data types or support for other browsers.                   |

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Performance:** Should complete cleanup within a reasonable time, even with multiple profiles.
- **Reliability:** Must not corrupt or damage Chrome profiles.
- **Usability:** Easy to use for non-technical users (especially if a GUI is provided).
- **Security:** Must not transmit any user data externally.

---

## 5. Constraints

- The tool must be run with appropriate user permissions to access Chrome’s profile directories.
- Chrome must be closed during cleanup to avoid file access conflicts.
- Some data (like cookies or passwords) may be encrypted and not fully removable without affecting profile integrity.

---

## 6. Out of Scope

- Managing or cleaning profiles for browsers other than Google Chrome.
- Cloud-based or remote profile management.
- Enterprise-level deployment and policy management.

---

## 7. Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Scheduling automatic cleanups.
- Integration with other browsers (Edge, Chromium, etc.).
- Advanced reporting and analytics on browsing data.
